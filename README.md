i'm in the process of adding digital hacks to my routine in order to compliment any analog systems i have in place now. ultimately, i'd like to have a useful system journaling system that could be the digital equivalent of a bullet journal. 

my repository is more a pathway for me to share the same files between my own devices and not for public consumption at this time.
